 The only real suggestion I would give is noting in the 
 lab instructions if using an IDE to run in local mode or 
 in my case with using VSCode, use WSL. Maybe for other people
 it was more intuitive to do this but I didn't realize it at 
 first and had to talk with some friends about what to do. 

 The final product was very satisfying to test out!
