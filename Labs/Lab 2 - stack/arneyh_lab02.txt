Hudson Arney
CSC 3320 003 - Operating Systems
Lab 2 - Stack Machine in C

Suggestions:
Maybe going through a bit more C in class or giving us more in class time 
to work on this since it would've been helpful to talk to a mentor for parts. 
I was still having trouble with the rotate command.

What I Enjoyed:
The fact that the lab was a bit simplier in scope than many other projects I'm working on.
I liked trying to get each method to work one at a time and it felt satisfing to get the correct output.
